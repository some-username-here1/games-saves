# Manual cloud-syncing for game saves
A repository of mine where I create text, shell, and batch files to use for cloud-syncing games that doesn't have cloud-sync, into your own cloud storage.

# Sources
A list of sources I've used for getting the correct directories for game saves, configuration, and etc.:
   - PCGamingWiki

# Note
This if you were to copy this repository and make your own folder in your own cloud storage (ex; "[...]\MEGA\Game Saves" or such). 

This folder is a root directory for containing saves of each game into its own folder; with the game's name being as the name's folder and a directory.txt provided for where the save/configuration would usually be saved at on the drive.

Folders that are excluded from having a "directory-*.txt" file in the root folder, due to saved files being in more than one directories:
   - Minecraft (when having multiple versions of it installed for different reasons)
   - Universe Sandbox
   - Universe Sandbox 2
   - Worms Reloaded

Games that are played via Proton in Linux:
   - Borderlands 2
   - Borderlands The Pre-Sequel
   - Crazy Machines Elements
   - Mushroom Wars
   - Subnautica
   - Worms Reloaded

# Contribution
If there's a video game of your own that you would have to add or a script that points to the wrong directory on Windows, Linux, or OSX, feel free to create an Issue or Pull Request! I appreciate every bit of help I can get.
