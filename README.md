# Manual cloud-syncing Games Saves
A repository of mine where I create text, shell, and batch files for cloud-syncing games that doesn't have cloud-sync.

# Note
This folder is a root directory for containing saves of each game into its own folder; with the game's name being as the name's folder and a directory.txt provided for where the save/configuration would usually be saved at on the drive.

Folders that are excluded from having a "directory-*.txt" file in the root folder, due to saved files in more than one directories:
   - Minecraft (when having multiple versions of it installed for different reasons)
   - Universe Sandbox
   - Universe Sandbox 2
   - Worms Reloaded

Games that are played via Proton in Linux:
   - Borderlands 2
   - Borderlands The Pre-Sequel
   - Crazy Machines Elements
   - Mushroom Wars
   - Subnautica
   - Worms Reloaded
